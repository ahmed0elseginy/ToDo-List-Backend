# ToDo-List-Backend
 This program represents a simple To-Do List application designed for demonstrating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API functionality. Unlike traditional applications, it does not rely on a database for data storage. Instead, it uses in-memory storage to manage the tasks, making it lightweight and ideal for basic use cases or educational purposes.  To enhance usability and documentation, the application integrates Swagger, which provides an intuitive interface for testing and interacting with the APIs directly from the browser. This feature simplifies exploring the available endpoints and their functionality.  Key Features:  Create: Add new tasks to the to-do list. Read: Retrieve the list of tasks or specific task details. Update: Modify existing tasks. Delete: Remove tasks from the list. This program is perfect for understanding the basics of RESTful APIs and practicing CRUD operations without the complexity of a database setup.
